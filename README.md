neural-network
================

This java library provides some basic operations with neural networks.

Only the backpropagation algorithm is currently implemented but in the future it is likely more will be added.

Usage
-----

You'll need to add a maven dependency
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.metabroadcast.neuralnetwork</groupId>
  <artifactId>neural-network</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

and include the MetaBroadcast repository: `http://mvn.metabroadcast.com/all'
to access this library via maven.
